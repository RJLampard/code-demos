## New Forms of Data

### Code demonstrations

In response to feedback from webinar participants, Julia and I propose hosting weekly coding demonstrations as part of the New Forms of Data training series. These would be 30 minute sessions - 20 minute demo, 10 minute Q&A - broadcast every Wednesday on a platform called Twitch; the schedules for May and June are below. Each session would focus on a fundamental computational task of relevance to social scientists e.g., importing data into Python, setting up a computational environment. Thus, the sessions are aimed at those with little programming experience.

#### Audience

Social scientists interested in programming and computational social science. No technicial expertise or programming experience is required.

The use of Twitch as a platform carries some pros and cons:
* **Pro** - Record the broadcast and publish on UKDS Youtube channel 
* **Pro** - Excellent setup for broadcasting live coding demonstrations (see example R course taught through Twitch: https://www.twitch.tv/wviechtb/clip/CheerfulSuspiciousCormorantKappaWealth)
* **Pro** - Potential to reach much larger audience
* **Con** - Difficult to capture details about who is watching; implications for demonstrating impact beyond simple measure of overall views (though we should be able to capture comments etc)

These sessions will obviously be branded as UKDS events, and advertised through the usual Comms channels.

#### May 2020

* Session 1 [2020-05-06 @4pm GMT] - Introduction to Python for social scientists
* Session 2 [2020-05-13 @4pm GMT] - Collecting data I: web-scraping
* Session 3 [2020-05-20 @4pm GMT] - Collecting data II: APIs
* Session 4 [2020-05-27 @4pm GMT] - Setting up your computational environment

#### June 2020

* Session 1 [2020-06-03 @4pm GMT] - Introduction to Python for social scientists
* Session 2 [2020-06-10 @4pm GMT] - Dealing with data I: structured datasets
* Session 3 [2020-06-17 @4pm GMT] - Dealing with data II: unstructured datasets
* Session 4 [2020-06-24 @4pm GMT] - Setting up your computational environment

#### Sign-up

1. Advertise through UKDS events page:
  * Sign-up information e.g., link to Twitch feed, login for Twitch, other resources
2. Individuals sign-up by providing brief demographic information.
3. Once booked on the demo, users receive a calendar confirmation with the Twitch link.

#### Evaluation

Try and run a poll/post-session evaluation to capture details of attendees (sector), do they want more etc. Harmonise with existing evaluation forms.

#### Security

Steps to enhance security:
* Use two-factor authentication
* Use a new password/set of credentials
* Do not link payment info to account

#### Advertising

1. Through UKDS events page.
2. Tag @UKDataService when advertising, cuts down on work for Comms.

#### Broadcasting

* Add a dislaimer about the broadcast.

#### Data

Ensure all datasets are open (add disclaimer) for this schedule.
